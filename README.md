## Overview

Legacy Windows desktop ClickOnce app for the XtremeIdiots gaming community to browse, upload, and replay Call of Duty 2/4/5 demos. Uses .NET Framework 4.8 WinForms with a shared `DemoManager.Library` for demo parsing (Huffman decode, config extraction) and local file handling. Integrates with the XtremeIdiots portal APIs to list and upload demos and with local game installs to detect paths and launch replays.

The app discovers locally installed games, lets players manage demo metadata, and uploads recordings to the portal APIs for long-term storage. Legacy maintenance only; changes focus on decommissioning support and security hygiene.
